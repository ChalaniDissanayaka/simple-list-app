# Simple React application that creates and displays lists of data.

This is a simple React application that creates and displays lists of data. The app allows users to input data items, which are then added to a dynamic list displayed on the page. Each data entry can be displayed as a list item, and users can update or remove items from the list. The app demonstrates key React concepts such as component state, props, and event handling to manage dynamic content efficiently.
